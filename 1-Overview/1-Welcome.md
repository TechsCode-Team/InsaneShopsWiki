# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing *Insane Shops*!
After installing it is recommended to add the ``insaneshops.admin`` permission to admins to access **/insaneshops** & other admin features.

<br>

To let your players make their own shops, you have to add the ``insaneshops.create`` permission to them. If your players should be able to create sell-shops additionally add the ``insaneshops.create.sellshop`` permission.

<br />

After following these steps the plugin should be fully functional and ready to use!
