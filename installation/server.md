# Server installation
First step is to download Insane Shops. You can find the files you need either: 
<br>
**[Here for SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/insane-shops.67352/updates)** 
<br>
**[Here for BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/insane-shops.19032/)**.
<br>
**[Here for PolyMart](https://polymart.org/product/1202/insane-shops)**.

Once you're done with this. `Stop your server`, and put the .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.
<br>

Once the .jar has been uploaded in your folder, you can start your server.
<br>

Once your server has started, a new folder called Insane Shops should have been created, inside the `plugins` directory. This means that Insane Shops has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>


## Testing the plugin
While your server is starting, look at the console for any possible [ERROR] message. Any [WARN] is not a problem, and will not disturb your use of the plugin.
<br>

You should now be able to do `/insaneshops` to open the GUI.
<br>
If you see a gui, that means you are good to go!
<br>

**`NOTE:` In order for the plugin to work properly, you'll need to have Vault and an Economy plugin installed on the server**
<br>
